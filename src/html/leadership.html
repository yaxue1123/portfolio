            <p>
                I served as the class president for two years in junior and senior year. Being the president, I played
                the role of a bridge
                between teachers and students, helped teachers allocate tasks to students and sent students'
                feedback
                to teachers. I learned a lot of communication skills through this position.

            <p>
                I went to Xifeng, Guizhou Province for a three-week voluntary teaching in my sophomore summer. This was
                an special experience
                because our target students were local teachers instead of students. By teaching teachers with compuetr
                skills,
                we can make greater impact on the local education since these teachers could apply what they 
                learnt to the following teaching tasks for years and impact thusands of students.
