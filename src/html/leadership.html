                I served as the class president for two years in junior and senior year. Being the president, I played the role of a bridge

                to teachers. I learned a lot communication skills through this.

                I went to Xifeng, Guizhou Province for a three-week voluntary teaching in my sophomore summer. This was an special experience
                because our target students were local teachers instead of students. By teaching teachers with compuetr skills,
                we can make greater impact on the local education.
